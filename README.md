#About

This site is intended to provide a single online destination for employers, peers and anyone else looking to get in touch with me. It also acts as my personal CSS playground, so don't be offended if the styles are overwhelming or inconsistent. 

Thanks for checking it out!

###Setup

To install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.

To build the static files:

```js
npm run build
```


To run tests in Node:

```js
npm test
```
